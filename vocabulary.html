The easiest way to publish your webpage is to use a web hosting service or a website builder. Here are some straightforward options:

### 1. **Using a Website Builder**
- **Wix, Weebly, or Squarespace**: These platforms allow you to create and publish websites without any coding. They offer drag-and-drop interfaces and templates, making it easy to design your site. You can publish your site with just a few clicks.

### 2. **Using GitHub Pages**
- If you're comfortable with Git, you can host your HTML files for free on GitHub Pages. Simply create a repository, upload your HTML file, and enable GitHub Pages in the repository settings. This is a great option for static sites.

### 3. **Using WordPress**
- **WordPress.com**: You can create a free account and publish your site using their platform. It’s user-friendly and doesn’t require coding skills. You can also upgrade for more features.

### 4. **Traditional Web Hosting**
- **Bluehost, SiteGround, or HostGator**: These services provide hosting where you can upload your HTML files. You’ll need to purchase a domain name and hosting plan, but they often have easy-to-use control panels for uploading files.

### Steps to Publish:
1. **Choose a Platform**: Decide whether you want to use a website builder or traditional hosting.
2. **Create an Account**: Sign up for the service you choose.
3. **Upload Your Files**: If using traditional hosting, use an FTP client (like FileZilla) to upload your HTML files to the server.
4. **Publish**: Follow the platform’s instructions to make your site live.

### Bonus Tip:
- **Free Hosting Options**: If you're looking for free options, platforms like GitHub Pages or Netlify allow you to host static sites without any cost.
